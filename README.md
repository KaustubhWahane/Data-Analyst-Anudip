I am a beginner learning data analytics from scratch and using this repo to mess around, break things, and slowly figure it out.

What I’m Learning
Spreadsheets: Excel / Google Sheets basics

SQL: simple queries to pull and filter data

Python: using Pandas and NumPy for basic analysis

Visualization: charts and simple dashboards to tell a story​

What’s In Here
Small practice exercises (cleaning, filtering, joining data)

Notebooks where I try ideas, make mistakes, and fix them

Notes to my future self on what I learned and what confused me​

Why This Exists
Track my progress as I go from “no clue” to “can actually analyze data”

Keep all my practice work in one place

Show honest, real learning instead of pretending to know everything​
